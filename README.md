# Bank-Management-System
Banking project using MYSQL and Python. 

->  The Bank management system is an application that is used to keep track of a person's bank account. The system gives the customer access to register for an account, make deposits or withdrawals, and examine reports for all active accounts.  
 

->  Managing customer and account information as well as the transactions that take place every minute or second. In addition to recording the transaction's specifics and other data, it also creates a report to support other banking operations. Numerous tasks are automated in this banking management system, which makes it easier for the bank to operate.
 

->  Major Functioning of Bank Management system: -


1. Customer: - These are the bank's primary source of revenue. The more customers you have, the better off you'll be in the market. Customers come in many various forms, ranging from regular folks to businesspeople, and everyone has an account according to the urgency of their needs.

2. Branch of bank: - Nearly all banks will always have several branches spread throughout numerous cities. We have this module to handle those branches across the system; it will maintain the manageability of the branches and provide each branch a distinct identity. Each branch will have a separate branch name and unique identification number.

3. Accounts of customers: - When someone opens a bank account, begins making deposits, or uses another service, they are considered a client. The account enables the client to utilise the services offered by the bank. Every customer has a special account number, and the bank will only use that number to identify you.

4. Transactions: - Transactions, which are similar logs but only provide the necessary information, are updated every time an account holder conducts any activity on the account. Transactions are used whenever a consumer modifies an account in any way, such as by paying or depositing money. This assists in monitoring the bank's cash flow.

5. Employees of bank: - A qualified person will always be needed for the proper administration of events, even when the bank has fully digitalized. Any bank's workers are its foundation. Hence, we have this module to help us manage the workforce. Their data will be maintained apart from that of the clients.
 

->  Importance of Bank Management system: -

Although technology streamlines many manual activities for the bank, the security of client data and assets is still a top issue, thus it is crucial to stay on top of security features and test each module thoroughly before deployment. The bank will benefit from this digitisation in all facets of its development.
 

->  Advantages of Bank Management system: -

1. As there won't be any physical files or data sheets to handle, the task will not only be easier but also completed at a much faster rate thanks to the system and machine.

2. With increased customer transparency and quick service, it will naturally win the trust of consumers.

3. The information about the customer, or if the customer wants to know their information, will be just a few clicks away.
